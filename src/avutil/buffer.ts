 *
 * @{
 * AVBuffer is an API for reference-counted data buffers.
 *
 * There are two core objects in this API -- AVBuffer and AVBufferRef. AVBuffer
 * represents the data buffer itself; it is opaque and not meant to be accessed
 * by the caller directly, but only through AVBufferRef. However, the caller may
 * e.g. compare two AVBuffer pointers to check whether two different references
 * are describing the same data buffer. AVBufferRef represents a single
 * reference to an AVBuffer and it is the object that may be manipulated by the
 * caller directly.
 *
 * There are two functions provided for creating a new AVBuffer with a single
 * reference -- av_buffer_alloc() to just allocate a new buffer, and
 * av_buffer_create() to wrap an existing array in an AVBuffer. From an existing
 * reference, additional references may be created with av_buffer_ref().
 * Use av_buffer_unref() to free a reference (this will automatically free the
 * data once all the references are freed).
 *
 * The convention throughout this API and the rest of FFmpeg is such that the
 * buffer is considered writable if there exists only one reference to it (and
 * it has not been marked as read-only). The av_buffer_is_writable() function is
 * provided to check whether this is true and av_buffer_make_writable() will
 * automatically create a new writable buffer when necessary.
 * Of course nothing prevents the calling code from violating this convention,
 * however that is safe only when all the existing references are under its
 * control.
 *
 * @note Referencing and unreferencing the buffers is thread-safe and thus
 * may be done from multiple threads simultaneously without any need for
 * additional locking.
 *
 * @note Two different references to the same buffer can point to different
 * parts of the buffer (i.e. their AVBufferRef.data will not be equal).

 * @{
 * AVBufferPool is an API for a lock-free thread-safe pool of AVBuffers.
 *
 * Frequently allocating and freeing large buffers may be slow. AVBufferPool is
 * meant to solve this in cases when the caller needs a set of buffers of the
 * same size (the most obvious use case being buffers for raw video or audio
 * frames).
 *
 * At the beginning, the user must call av_buffer_pool_init() to create the
 * buffer pool. Then whenever a buffer is needed, call av_buffer_pool_get() to
 * get a reference to a new buffer, similar to av_buffer_alloc(). This new
 * reference works in all aspects the same way as the one created by
 * av_buffer_alloc(). However, when the last reference to this buffer is
 * unreferenced, it is returned to the pool instead of being freed and will be
 * reused for subsequent av_buffer_pool_get() calls.
 *
 * When the caller is done with the pool and no longer needs to allocate any new
 * buffers, av_buffer_pool_uninit() must be called to mark the pool as freeable.
 * Once all the buffers are released, it will automatically be freed.
 *
 * Allocating and releasing buffers with this API is thread-safe as long as
 * either the default alloc callback is used, or the user-supplied one is
 * thread-safe.
